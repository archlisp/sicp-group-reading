We've voted on Racket as the language.

We'll use this repo for the code.

We'll watch the videos ourselves *AS HOMEWORK* before the next meeting.

We'll go through the exercises in person.

We voted to go through the old videos.

## Let's install Racket.

```
brew install racket
```

Scheme and Racket in Emacs:

http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/

```
M-x package-install RET geiser RET
```

It's b0rk3n!

https://github.com/jaor/geiser/issues/39

```
raco pkg install compatibility-lib
```

It worked!

```
raco pkg install sicp
```

The most simple Racket file, working in my Emacs:
