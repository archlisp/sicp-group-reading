Everybody has Racket installed!

Everybody has watched the video!

## Starting Geiser in Emacs

1. ~`M-x run-geiser` in a `*.rkt` file.~
2. ~Pick `racket` implementation.~

1. Nevermind, just do `M-x run-racket` instead.
2. Evaluate at the REPL: `,enter "lecture-1a.rkt"`
3. From then on you can `C-x C-e` to load a single form.

Check out [`lecture-1a.rkt`](lecture-1a.rkt), we go through most of the exercises in the book.

## Homework

Maybe do Exercise 1.8

Watch the [Lecture 1B video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlbMuv-jix8) for next month!
